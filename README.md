# Generic Circuit Level Tool for Evaluation of Nano-Cross Bar Memory using Memristors
The Generic Circuit Level Tool for Evaluation of Nano-Cross Bar Memory using Memristors is a software tool designed to help researchers and engineers in the field of memristor technology. It is a circuit level tool that automates the process of generating the memristor array circuit in a spice environment, making it easier and faster for researchers to design and simulate memristor circuits. The tool also allows researchers to easily modify and optimize the simulation circuit parameters, such as the size of the memristor array circuit or the type of memristor used. 

The tool is significant because it helps to ease the researchers' job and enable faster development of memristor-based technology. It is particularly useful in the simulation of memristor cross bar arrays, which plays an important role in collecting data and studying the characteristics of memristors. As the array size increases, the difficulties increase exponentially in designing the cross bar array circuit manually. Therefore, the tool is a valuable asset to help streamline the circuit design process and help researchers free up valuable time to explore new applications for memristor technology.
